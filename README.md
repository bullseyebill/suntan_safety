## Running the site

As you load the main page you will see that we have an input box for you to type in your current location or even to check a remote location
(if you are checking  the UV for somewhere else)
The text box will remind you that it does require you to 'Please enter a location'

Upon completing this task you will be given a confirmation of your location and also the Maximum UV expected at that location.
